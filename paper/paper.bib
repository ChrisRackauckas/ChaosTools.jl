abstract = {Finite systems of deterministic ordinary nonlinear differential equations may be designed to represent forced dissipative hydrodynamic flow. Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

  abstract={The authors investigate numerically how typical trajectories fill the phase space in low-dimensional symplectic (Hamiltonian) maps with finite phase space. They do not find any sign of a 'chaos threshold' as reported by other authors when the non-linearity parameters are increased. Instead, as expected from Arnold diffusion, they find that single trajectories fill most (if not all) of the coarse-grained phase space even for very small non-linearities. Due to the 'stickiness' of tori also observed in two-dimensional maps, this filling is much slower than what one might expect naively and is possibly described by power laws. The 'chaos threshold' observed in a previous paper is explained as a trivial effect.}
